## Testing, Application and Safety Notes

### Testing and Operation
1. Power Supply:
    + Use a stable 12 V DC source such as a solar panel or battery.
2. Measure Voltage:
    + Use a multimeter to ensure the transformerâ€™s secondary coil outputs 220 V AC.
3. Load Testing:
    + Connect a small AC appliance to verify proper operation.
