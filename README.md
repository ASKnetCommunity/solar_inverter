## Training schedule 
### Day 1
+ Day 1 started with an introduction, the trainees introduced themselves and their interests as well as staff.
+ The participants were briefed about the purpose of the training and the participants were asked to write down their expectations.
+ The participants were introduced to basic tools for repair and were taken through the various types of mobile phones and its parts. 
+ The 16 women trainees were then grouped into 3 groups, each consisting of 5 members and discussed topics such as common mobile phone faults, procedures to consider when doing a repair and steps in troubleshooting and soldering a device. They were given questions to discussed 

### Day 2
+ A check-in and recap session was conducted to evaluate the level of understanding of the participants about what they have learnt on day one.
+ The students were introduced to what a solar inverter is and how to use a digital multimeter to test electronic components.
+ They were also taken through the steps in designing and building a DIY solar inverter from electronics waste.
Using sticky notes, the students were asked to give feedback about the training.
